--Finally I can get to the heaven to meet my husband. 
He promised to come back to me in 1942, after his serving our country he said. 
I don’t know why I’m telling you this but thanks for listening to the mumbles from a very old lady young man.
--I was about to sign up with him in 1942, and I’m so sorry that I didn’t. 
Young man, could you please pass some message to my girl that mama is leaving here soon, don’t bother coming so often. 
Every time when she shows up in all black as she always does, I felt so touched but also so bad.
