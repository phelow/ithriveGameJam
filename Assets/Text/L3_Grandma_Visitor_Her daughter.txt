--My mum is a brave women. 
She was holding so much things for me on her own shoulder for me…
--I heard her crying in her bedroom for several times when I was young. 
I was too insensitive then to feel the way she was. 
Now this feeling is just overwhelming me…
--I’m sure she will meet my father in the place that far away and high from here, right? 
Please tell me yes… 
Oh lord I can’t help this… *sobbing*
