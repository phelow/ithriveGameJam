--My family come all the way from the other side of the Pacific Ocean to the states when I was 7 and I barely know how to speak English. 
Neither fluently nor even properly, couldn’t I just speak English at that time. 
So you know, I was kind of struggling in my school time, and being kept making fun of. 
That’s probably the moment when I set up my mind to be someone that can receive people’s respect for sure.
--I wasn’t that good with my courses during school, so I just got dropped out in my freshman year of college. 
I was working at a lot of entrance positions, well to be honest I think the phrase “entrance level” is even a little bit beyond to describe a cleaner who worked after mid-night in an Asian food restaurant. 
Then luckily one of my old friends introduced me to the police station.
--And oh my god I was like finding the paradise of my life. 
I mean, totally being respected, and since then I never had to worry about whether or not I could put some food on the table for myself every single day. 
I REALLY love this job, even that I did know the fact that they always tried to push the fresh guy to “front line”.
And someday somehow, here I am.
